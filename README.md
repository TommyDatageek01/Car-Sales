The data was then imprted into Tableau

## Insights
The major highlight from the visualization are as follows:


1. ### Price Decrease (-0.79%)*:
2. This indicates that, on average, the prices of the products or services have been decreasing year after year. This could be due to various factors such as
   - Market competition
   - Changes in production costs
   - Shifts in consumer preferences.

4. ### Total Sales Growth (23.59%):
   Despite the decrease in prices, the business experienced a significant growth in total sales. This is a positive sign, as it means that even though individual car items were priced lower, the volume of sales increased substantially.

5. ### Car Sold Growth (24.57%):
   This shows a substantial increase in the number of cars sold year on year. This could be attributed to various factors such as:
   - Increased demand
   - Effective marketing strategies
   - Improvements in product offerings.

## Implications for the Business:

- ### Market Penetration:
  The business seems to be effectively capturing a larger share of the market with the increased number of cars sold.

- ### Competitive Pricing:
  The decrease in average prices might indicate that the business is adopting a competitive pricing strategy to attract more customers.

- ### Revenue Growth:
  The combination of increased sales volume and potentially lower prices could lead to overall revenue growth.

- ### Customer Acquisition and Retention:
  The increase in total sales and cars sold suggests that the business is either acquiring new customers or effectively retaining existing ones.

- ### Margin Consideration:
  While total sales are growing, it's important to consider if the business is maintaining healthy profit margins despite the decrease in prices.

Overall, the business seems to be making strategic moves to stimulate growth by increasing sales volume, even if it means adjusting pricing strategies.

## Recommendation
It's important to continue monitoring these trends and perhaps conduct further analysis to understand the underlying drivers behind these changes.
